# Natural Language Processing on ChatGPT Prompts

## Project Overview

This project delves into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by applying advanced techniques to analyze and cluster ChatGPT prompts. The goal is to uncover common scenarios where users engage with the model and reveal patterns in the prompts.

## Key Highlights

- **Prompt Clustering:** Implemented a clustering approach to group ChatGPT prompts, shedding light on common scenarios and use cases where users interact with the model.

- **Text Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough preprocessing of the text data, employing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction to enhance the quality of the data for analysis.

- **Unsupervised Learning Techniques:** Utilized K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to perform unsupervised learning on the prompt data. These techniques helped identify distinct prompt patterns and topics without labeled training data.

- **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization:** Applied t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for dimensionality reduction, enabling the visualization of clustering results and providing insights into the relationships between different prompt groups.
